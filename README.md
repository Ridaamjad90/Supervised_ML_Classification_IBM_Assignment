The attached notebook encompasses a heart disease dataset with 918 observations. I've taken this dataset from kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/fedesoriano/heart-failure-prediction. It includes the features that are attributes of a patient such as Age, Sex, Chest Pain Type, Resting BP etc. And the Target variable tells whether the patient has a heart disease or not.

The purpose of this notebook is to come up with a model that can accurately predict given the attributes of a patient if they have a cardiovascular disease or not. A machine learning model of this kind can be useful in early detection and management
